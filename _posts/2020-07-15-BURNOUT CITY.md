**WEALTH ENGINE**

It is popularly held that the wealth of nations is increasingly dependent on the productivity and innovativeness of cities [1][2]. Urban proximity affords the emergence of &quot;dynamical, richly diverse, and interconnected systems&quot;, allowing the incubation of ideas, the recombination of factors, and the reassociation of people. These are the things that allow new forms and functions to be generated. The metropolis is, thereby, seen as a &quot;social reactor&quot; [3] which, by virtue of its &quot;sheer number of and variety of divisions of labour&quot;, is brimming with creative potentiality [4]. The various ways the city gets more out of less – &#39;agglomeration economies&#39; and &#39;agglomeration externalities&#39; – represent the &quot;triumph of the city&quot; [5].

For some, there is more triumph left to be had. It is thought that, if a class of specialists could master the &quot;social physics&quot; of the city, then they can &quot;tune the flows of ideas between people by providing small incentives, or nudges, to individuals&quot;, thereby making the reactor &quot;more flexible, creative, and productive&quot; [6].

But _what is it like_ being fuel in a social reactor? What is the experience of the urban subject in a socioeconomic wealth engine?

**DELIRIOUS CITY**

The modern metropolis was the mass social medium before the digital social media came into existence. The hyperdensity of full-sensory interactions in the metropolis makes it a &quot;hot medium&quot; by Marshall McLuhan&#39;s definition [7]. The artists – whose job it is to catalyse, and give expression to, a population&#39;s cultural immune system – have confirmed the kindling of a great metaphysical flame with the birth of the modern metropolis. Fire, however, has always been an ambivalent technology.

Honoré de Balzac&#39;s preferred metaphor for the modern city was &#39;inferno&#39; [8], invoking Dante&#39;s hell city of Dis. Maxim Gorky&#39;s description of Manhattan is all roaring flames [9]. Those flames would later sublimate into Marvel Comic&#39;s first ever superhero: the Human Torch of New York City, who began his career as a human-made android that unintendedly burst into flames upon contact with oxygen. The story arch has the android change from villainous monstrosity to hero undercover in the city&#39;s police force [10]. Here, the inferno is tamed in symbol to prefigure its taming in reality. The "psychological lava" which Colin Rowe claimed to be the "substratum of the modern city" in 1978, erupts, destroying Los Angeles in the 1997 movie _Volcano_ [11].  

What constitutes this inferno? What does &#39;hyperdensity of full-sensory interactions&#39; mean?

For Robert Alter, the phantasmagoric urban scene accustoms the urban mind to &quot;grasping shards of sensory data and jagged ends&quot;, pulling it unnaturally on the edge to a scattered mode of awareness, never allowing it to center. Immersion in an anonymous urban crowd &quot;produces a kind of imaginative binge&quot; [12] – a human pleasure for sure, but also a distracted mode for the restless mind. Without forcing the point, it may be asked: what is the nature of this social medium, and can its use become addictive or problematic in some other way?

In the warm, dry months of a city that experiences seasonal changes, a discordant symphony of crying and gnashing machines reaches fever pitch during the day. These are the sounds of the city making room for more people and repairing the wear-and-tear that inevitably comes with opposing nature. On a typical walk through summertime metropolis one might hear: sirens, alarms, horns, accelerating trucks, reversing trucks, conspicuous driving, breaking buses, breaking rail cars, large pneumatic arms, saws, drills, compactors, sprayers, jack hammers, ventilators, mixers, leaf blowers, water pumps, trimmers, lawn mowers, bush whackers, helicopters, radios, etc.

The hyperdensity of the modern metropolis is susceptible to hyper-externalities – externalities that compound to great heights, such as the machine noises that meet in the ears of the urban subject. Anyone who has lived next to a construction site will know a special kind of torture; a torture that one may feel a slight shame in complaining about because it is such a common urban experience. Because machine silence is the medium of deep thought and peace of mind, an informal market for it emerges. Public libraries carve out a space of machine silence for all, but private spaces of reliable machine silence, which are also accessible to urban amenities, are harder to come by.

Is it any wonder then that, for many, the urban environment represents conditions that periodically inspire a longing to &#39;get away from it all&#39;. Hence, every social reactor threatens eruption without liberal use of its pressure relief valves, i.e. its &#39;getaways&#39;. They include the access to idyllic hinterlands and trips abroad, but also the presence of urban oases – &#39;cottage country in the city&#39;. Coney Island beach was once described as a &quot;monstrous safety valve of the world&#39;s most highly charged metropolis&quot; [13].

These are the signs that the modern metropolis was the birthplace of burnout.

<br>
**CITIES AND WORK**

To say that &quot;Cities are primarily labour markets&quot; [14] is to assert an unfortunate reality: that work has come to dominate the lives of many people everywhere, especially the inhabitants of large world cities. In 2019 the World Health Organization called burnout an &quot;occupational phenomenon&quot; and advised that the term &quot;should not be applied to describe experiences in other areas of life&quot; [15]. This may prove short-sighted. However, the degree to which the city can be said to be a labour market, and the degree to which work (especially cognitive work) dominates urban culture, is the degree to which the inhabitants of the &#39;city as workplace&#39; are susceptible to occupational burnout.

The modern metropolis has been celebrated for the freedom of personal expression, learning, and sharing that it facilitates. This freedom allows the further division of labour in society, with concomitant productivity gains [16]. These are affordances of the hyperconnected urban medium for personal cognition, with consequences for collective cognition. However, we could take instruction from Barbara Tversky&#39;s First Law of Cognition which states: &quot;there are no benefits without costs&quot; [17]. It is often wise to assume a theory of trade-offs – which produces U-shaped relationships – when it comes to the conditions conducive to well-being. Abstracting away the urban subject in a purely physicalist theory makes it easy to forget that. The potential flipside of freedom is &quot;anomie&quot;. Durkheim used the term to describe the &quot;malady of the infinite&quot; brought on by the unchecked division of labour in society. The hyperconnected medium turns the dial away from solid-certain-shared norms toward liquid-possible-diverse norms, which can produce feelings of alienation and purposelessness within people [18]. This is just one of the &#39;paradoxes&#39; of freedom/choice that have been explored over the years.

In his book _The Burnout Society_, the philosopher Byung-Chul Han posits that the modern &quot;achievement society&quot;, with its insatiable drive to maximize production, is a product of this &quot;excessive positivity&quot; [19]. By &quot;excessive positivity&quot; he means the conditions under which people are overstimulated and experience a greatly diminished resistance to personal expression. These are conditions where anything is possible and, therefore, everything is expected from an individual. He argues that such an environment drives people to exploit themselves to the point of burnout.

To the overly stereotypical neoliberal economist: people are never economically rational enough, therefore capital and labour are never mobile enough, therefore markets are never efficient enough. But in the perfectly neoliberal city, where people are infinitely flexible and reactive, there can be no such thing as character, community, or sovereignty in any meaningful sense. The degree to which economic markets determine behaviour is the degree to which the not-easily-commodifiable aspects of life risk being woefully undersupplied (e.g. care, companionship, authenticity itself). Without significant opposing effort, such a cultural environment becomes void of the life-affirming qualities that inspire people to sustain their efforts.

Figure 2 below hints at a positive association between susceptibility to burnout and city size. It presents the 2019 burnout index for 69 cities (in 53 countries) against the log of their populations, showing that approximately 40% of the variance in burnout index can be accounted for by city size. The burnout index used was created by SavvySleeper from several sources, featuring data on: &quot;Time Spent in Traffic From Work&quot;, &quot;Mental Health Disorder &amp; Substance Abuse Prevalence&quot;, &quot;Employee Presenteeism&quot;, &quot;Vacation Time&quot;, &quot;Amount of Stressed Employee Reviews&quot;, &quot;Lack of Motivation at Work&quot;, &quot;Annual Work Hours&quot;, &quot;Population Working More Than 48 Hours&quot;, and &quot;Population Sleeping Less Than 7 Hours&quot; [20]. This relationship is open for more thorough research.

It could be the case that freedom without overstimulation avoids its possible deleterious effects on well-being. But an &#39;attention economy&#39; of escalating competitors is likely to emerge in any mass medium with freedom of expression. And the creation of &#39;supernormal stimuli&#39; is one prominent tactic of &#39;information warfare&#39; in such a hyperconnected medium.

<br>
**CITIES AND DESIRE**

&quot;The city is, amoung other things, a great emporium, displaying its multifarious wares to excite desires&quot; [21]. Those wares adorn the people, parking spaces, and property lines; are displayed in windows and shelves; and feature in advertisements that cover the surfaces of the city, including the interior and exterior of its mass transit. In the subway car, one often has no choice other than to be continually spammed.

It is easy to stoke the flames of desire in a hyperconnected medium. Like other mass media, &quot;The urban world puts a premium on visual recognition&quot; [22], and, therefore, in its conspicuity, it is the place where status anxieties are highest [23]. &#39;Keeping up with the Joneses&#39; has found empirical confirmation. In his study of U.S. households, Erzo Luttmer found that, &quot;controlling for an individual&#39;s own income, higher earnings of neighbors are associated with lower levels of self-reported happiness&quot; [24]. To what extent is your city a veritable &quot;theatre of envy&quot;, propagating more mimetic desire ("fire of envy") than it can hope to satiate in a healthy dosage? [25]

Lewis Mumford condemned the world metropolis as a place of &quot;negative vitality&quot;; a place where people productively work to return to an equilibrium that they are constantly pushed out of. For him, James Joyce&#39;s protagonist in Ulysses, Leopold Bloom, epitomized this state [26]:

>James Joyce, in Ulysses, projected this phantasmal state: he showed the mind of Leopold Bloom regurgitating the contents of the newspaper and the advertisement, living in a hell of unfulfilled desires, vague wishes, enfeebling anxieties, morbid compulsions, and dreary vacuities: a dissociated mind in a disintegrated city: perhaps the normal mind of the world metropolis.

In _Invisible Cities_, Italo Calvino summed up this sanguine perspective when he wrote this of the habitants of a fictious city called Anastasia [27]:

>your labour which gives form to desire takes from desire its form, and you believe you are enjoying Anastasia wholly when you are only its slave.

It is acknowledged that just like productivity, crime rates tend to scale super-linearly with city size, within a system of cities [28]. Because the city intensifies human interactions, this ill is thought to be like waste heat leaking from the urban wealth engine. However, this is not an explanation per se. One may well suspect that crime rates has something to do with the way the city inflames desires, which leads to the other correlates of crime such as father absenteeism [29] and a &#39;charred&#39; social fabric [30]. The Tao Te Ching says: &quot;Don&#39;t display what people desire, And their hearts will not be disturbed&quot; [31]. The Hebrew Bible commands: &quot;You shall not covet … anything that your fellow man has&quot; [32]. If the city is like &quot;a great emporium, displaying its multifarious wares to excite desires&quot;, is it any wonder that urban eruptions of outrage and despair often end in the senseless looting? Wisdom traditions from the East and West are like lifelong training programs in desire management, but the metropolis of today is profligate in its mass production of desire.

<br>
**CITIES AND CRIME**

The economist Gary Becker theorized that crime was like an economically rational investment given the criminal&#39;s set of available opportunities. This set might include both criminal and non-criminal ways of &#39;getting ahead&#39;. If the reward-risk ratio is perceived to be highest for a criminal project, then that project will be pursued, i.e. the crime will be attempted [33]. In Kendrick Lamar&#39;s rap album _Good Kid, M.A.A.D City_, in which he artfully recounts his torn coming-of-age on the streets of Compton, Los Angeles, there is a song line which goes: &quot;Home invasion was persuasive. / From nine to five I know its vacant&quot; [34]. Even using Becker&#39;s mechanical theory of crime, when the &#39;haves&#39; and &#39;have-nots&#39; collocate, one might intuitively expect increased crime rates, especially in a place where institutions and communities are having a hard time keeping pace with techno-economic &#39;disruptions&#39;.

In fact, strong empirical evidence suggests that income inequality is among the best predictors of violent crime rates at different geographic scales, including the level of the city. Martin Daly&#39;s extensive empirical research suggests that income inequality is a better predictor of crime than poverty, emphasizing its social aspect. He concludes: &quot;where desired goods are distributed inequitably and competition for those goods is severe, dangerous tactics of competition are appealing and a high homicide rate is just one of many unfortunate consequences&quot; [35]. Economists Edward Glaeser, Matt Resseger, and Kristina Tobio have also made the connection between urban inequality and rates of crime [36].

In the same album, Kendrick Lamar voices his mother warning him about his gang lifestyle of temporary winners, on the chorus of the song _The Art of Peer Pressure_, repeating the words: &quot;One day it&#39;s gon&#39; burn you out&quot; [37].

Unsurprisingly, income inequality is also found to positively correlated with city size [38]. If the city is a wealth engine, to what extent is it hastening the global economy&#39;s historic tendency to accumulate more wealth into fewer hands [39], and disrupt societies, potentially making this world more unsafe?

Among the other things that have been said about crime, is that crime rates and temperature are positively associated [40][41]. This adds another dimension to the urban heat island effect. When &#39;the block is hot&#39;, it might be the case both figuratively and literally.

<br>
**CITIES AND INNOVATION**

Interestingly, Robert Merton&#39;s strain theory of social deviance uses the term &#39;innovation&#39; to describe the activities whereby culturally approved goals are pursued by socially unapproved or unconventional means [42]. For him, &#39;innovation&#39; can include illegal forms of personal enrichment such as theft and dealing drugs. The metropolis is innovative indeed. Merton&#39;s usage of the term &#39;innovation&#39; suggests that many legal and illegal forms of &#39;creative destruction&#39; may be alike in the phenomenology of their motivation, in some nontrivial sense. Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s motto &quot;Move fast and break things&quot; seems perfectly applicable as a creed for inflamed urban rioters and looters, especially in light of the unsavory activities of many tech companies, including Facebook. Companies like Uber seem to suggest that breaking the law is indeed a requirement for innovation.

Nowhere does this idea of a phenomenological quasi-equivalence of crime and innovation come to life better than in the 1995 move _Heat_. This classic was directed by Michael Mann; stars Al Pacino and Robert De Niro; is set in Los Angeles; and was inspired by true events in Chicago [43]. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) and Niel McCauley (De Niro) work on opposite sides of the law, but they develop a sort of mutual respect because each has a singular commitment to his work. Hanna, the ace lieutenant, and McCauley, the expert thief, are both possessed by pathological drives which absolutely preclude the possibility of healthy relationship with others. Locked in mortal competition, the two are the kind of raging workaholics that make for an entertaining crime film.

Despite his evident material success, McCauley continues to nurse a dream of escaping to the Pacific Islands. It is part of his plan, but the audience suspects that the dream is a blue horizon that forever recedes, to be punctured by the red of violence. In the end, lieutenant Hanna shoots McCauley, after a chase around the airside of LAX airport. Disturbed and saddened, Hanna holds McCauley&#39;s hand in comfort as the latter succumbs to his wounds. One could not get away and the other never wanted to. Director Christopher Nolan took considerable inspiration from _Heat_ for his Gotham City in _The Dark Knight_. In an interview he said he wanted &quot;to tell a very large, city story or story of a city&quot; [44].

<br>
The habitus of the metropolis is more and more taking the shape of 'Total Innovation' - to adapt Josef Pieper's concept of "Total Work" [45]. This is an environment where the 'talented' hack together new, disruptive revenue streams for wealthy speculators in 'innovation clusters' designed for such purposes. Many of the remainder navigate the resultant gigs, in an endless process of self-reinvention and self-commodification. Some of the so-called talent even spend some of their weekends and nights at hackathons, creating value for, and publicizing, existing companies. These hackathons are events where innovation is forced to happen within a given time period. In Startup City, life is on pause because the future is always now. Life in "the innovation complex" tends to a state of permamnent exception due to its emphatic future orientation. Rarely does anyone in such a epistemic community question the feverish demand for innovation and the effects of orienting life around it. In _The Innovation Complex_, Sharon Zukin describes how the pools of impatient capital tranformed the culture and fabric of New York City in the years following the global financial meltdown, and how its inherent contridictions manifest themselves in a new regime of urban issues [46]. Althought Zukin focuses on New York City, it is as Michael Swaine and Paul Freiberger remark in the third edition of their book _Fire in the Valley_: "The fire of the revolution that the personal computer ignited continues to spread" [47].   

<br>
**CITIES AND EXPECTIATIONS**

Delirium, anomie, burnout, unsatiated desires, crime – this is surely an exaggeration, no? Why would people continue to choose to urbanize at the rate of hundreds of millions per year [48], if it is not the preferred choice?

Of course, cities are not inevitably and categorically deleterious to wellbeing and effective livelihood. However, it has long been known that we often make choices contra to our wellbeing, especially when we are bombarded with the glittering images of mass media which have their own agenda. The city is more than a landscape of economic opportunities. It is a cultural emergent, casting its light to the world through music, movies, and other electronic and digital media. As Louis Wirth put it, &quot;the city … must recruit its migrants from other cities, the countryside, and … from other countries&quot; [49]. One group of researchers takes a behavioural science approach to the study of location decisions. They suggest that &quot;outcomes and experiences of urban life compare poorly with the overoptimistic expectations of many newcomers&quot;, and that this is due to certain biases, heuristics, and cognitive limitations in our appraisal and decision-making [50]. There has been a growing concern that urbanization is no longer associated with social mobility [51]. Despite this, people continue to take the gamble.

Inequality&#39;s geographic manifestations have been studied and documented in reports such as David Hulchanski&#39;s _The Three Cities Within Toronto_. The 35 years between 1970 and 2005 saw the population of the City of Toronto double from approximately 2.5M to approximately 5M people. Hulchanski showed that, during this time, the &quot;middle-income area of the city shrank dramatically&quot;, explaining further that &quot;It is not the case that middle-income people in the city have simply moved to the outer suburbs …, since the trends are largely the same in those areas too [52]. Figure 3 below is taken from his report. The colours represent neighbourhoods where the average incomes are 20% less than (red), 20% more than (blue), and within 20% of, the Toronto Metropolitan Area average income. His succession of maps shows a city catching fire.

  <figcaption><i>Figure 3 - Average Individual Income, City of Toronto, Relative to the Toronto CMA, 1970-2005 (source: Hulchanski, 2007)</i></figcaption>
</figure>

A song featured in the 1973 movie _Walking Tall_ may have captured the sentiment of many [53]:

<div align="center">
<i>Made a mistake long time ago <br>
&#39;Cause I wanted to see the lights of the city <br>
The big town called me and I just had to go <br>
But a fire behind the lights is not too pretty <br>
Hey, hey, hey <br>
Cause I&#39;m coming home on the very next train, yes <br>
I&#39;m coming home and I&#39;ll never leave again <br></i>
</div>

<br>
However, for many, there is no real home to return to. In the age of mass media and technological disruptions, it is easier to erode a community than to create one. As Jane Jacobs expressed in _Dark Age Ahead_: once a community dissolves, the memory of its existence often fades, and one forgets that one has forgotten [54]. This especially the case to the extent that an influx of capital turns a place of community into a node in the supply network feeding a metropolis of consumption – &#39;Domicide&#39; my other means than physical violence.

<br>
**BURNOUT CITY**

It must be stated again that the suggestion here is not that large cities are inevitably and categorically deleterious to well-being. Much has been done to revitalize, and improve the livability of, major cities across the world. Urban successes should not be taken for granted, wherever they are found.

Burnout City is, rather, an attempt to balance the triumphalist accounts of urban living. It asks whether the very same properties that make the city a wealth engine have tended to make it harmful to the well-being of many urbanites. It is also an attempt to reassert the considerations of urban interiority (what it is like for the urban subject) in the discourse toward a truly Unified Theory of Urban Living.

Burnout City (re)introduces into Urban Studies the difficulties that the Behavioural Sciences have had on the question of personal autonomy. A city – institutions, infrastructure, spatial distributions, designs, narratives – is like a complex of &#39;choice architectures&#39; that influence decision-making, the experience of autonomy, and culture. People shape, and are shaped by, the city – the efficacy of the former effort is determined by how much the latter outcome serves life-affirming values and enhances sovereignty. Addressing Burnout City is not a matter of curbing freedoms per se, but, rather, paying better attention to the biases of choice architectures and continuing the work of restoring the social fabric. A strong culture of trust is the is the most efficient institution against societal ills.

As a concept, Burnout City represents a negative region in the vast phase space (landscape) of possible cities. Actual cities are positioned at various distances from its epicentre. Positing its existence is the first step towards moving away from it; staying clear of it; and moving toward a better urban world for all. One with more light than heat.
