**COOPERATIVE CAPITAL**

Capital is a broad term representing all the tangible and intangible resources with which a kind of valued thing or effect can be created. _Cooperative Capital_ is, therefore, the collection of available resources with which a group of people can cooperate, at various degrees of intensity and extensity. The more Cooperative Capital a group of people has, the larger the number of _effective livelihoods_ they can accommodate, and the more effectively they can adapt to disruptions. In other words, more Cooperative Capital implies greater the _carrying capacity_ and/or greater _adaptability_.

Cooperation, simply put, is any social activity in which at least one participant has the intent to realize a _positive sum_. Cooperation does not necessarily imply altruism[1]; any positive sum generated through cooperation can be appropriated by a subset of participants [2]. In this article, cooperation excludes any interaction under the the threat of violence, regardless of net outcome. Cooperation can include anything from law abiding behaviour and market transactions, to resource pooling and creative collaboration. However, the more people finding themselves successfully engaged in activities towards the latter, the better their ability to find and play _positive sum__games_, and the more likely those activities will generate _positive externalities_.

<br>
**THE FOUR DIMENSIONS**

The _Four Dimensions_ of Cooperative Capital are the four essential enabling directions of these resources. In no particular order, they are:

1. Communication
2. Transportation
3. Computation
4. Trust

It may hold that that every solution offered to society aims at enhancements along one or more of these dimensions. The following are two examples which demonstrate.

A political ideology – its system of texts and symbols – is disseminated via different transportation and communication channels. Its aim is to inspire trust in a class of leaders, or in political abstractions, which thereby prompt people to cooperate at scale more effectively.

A ride-hailing service seeks widespread adoption. It uses computer algorithms for many things, including calculating prices in real-time; matching riders with drivers; calculating driver ratings (a stand-in for trust); and more. It allows drivers and riders to communicate after being matched. In enabling door-to-door service, it avoids public transportation&#39;s _last mile problem_. As such, it is a market platform that drastically reduces transaction costs, allowing impersonal cooperation at scale. If people have largely positive experiences using the service, they come to trust it.

The following sections will discuss the Four Dimensions of Cooperative Capitalas they relate to cities. The city is an appropriate entity for analysis because, of the successful mass social media platforms, it is the only one that exists in physical space – an intimacy that can strain _social preferences_ in more fatal ways than virtual spaces currently allow. Referring to urban living, the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah called it &quot;little short of miraculous that brains shaped by our long history could have been turned to this new way of life&quot; [3].

Fitting many thousands of strangers into a geographic area that would naturally only accommodate a few hundred non-strangers, continually inspires innovations for facilitating cooperation at scale and for getting more from less. The city is not only an &#39;idea reactor&#39; but it also facilitates the realization of those ideas. This is the &quot;triumph of the city&quot; [4].

<br>
**COMMUNICATION**

It goes without saying that the ability for agents to communicate – whether orally, telemetrically or by some other principle – is fundamental to cooperation. Plato limited the size of his ideal city to &quot;5,024 citizens – a quantity of people that could be realistically addressed by a human voice&quot; [5]. Thus, we can appreciate how, without the powerful &#39;extensions of man&#39;, the ability to cooperate meaningfully at scale is technically infeasible. The ample flow of information allows informed decision-making and, thereby, the effective allocation of resources. The division of labour in society, and the resulting gains in productivity, would be impossible without a vast communications infrastructure – including fibre backbones, cell towers, Wi-Fi kiosks, roadways, etc – which reduce _transactions costs_ [6].

What has been dubbed the &#39;sharing economy&#39; is a uniquely urban phenomenon, to the extent that is intensifies that what the city has always done: allow access to pools of resources and people, facilitate the recombination thereof [7]. Advanced telecommunications technologies have allowed each modern city to develop a digital layer that makes it easier to navigate and query, for enhanced place-based engagement.

<br>
**TRANSPORTATION**

Also fundamental to cooperation at scale is the ability to organize and access resources and people, in space. Accessibility is a function of the _distribution_ of resources and people, and the _generalized cost_ of transportation between them [8]. A city&#39;s transportation system, therefore, limits its effective size. _Marchetti&#39;s constant_ describes the close correspondence between the geographic size of a city and the distance residents can travel in 30 minutes from their homes. It, therefore, lends credence to the idea that city dwellers have roughly similar commuting time budgets [9]. Consequently, commuting experiences are one of the main causes of stress, and one of the main points of political contestation, in the city.

Further, many urbanists suggest that the comingling of different groups of people in public spaces can act counter to the human tendency to otherize those who appear unfamiliar [10]. In other words, peoples&#39; accessibility to many diverse others can encourage cosmopolitan attitudes. Hence, the transportation network of a city can be a great equalizer, and tool of cooperation, to the degree that it allows seamless travel between neighbourhoods and prevents isolated homogenous pockets from forming.

Conjugate to communication, transportation permits the furtherdivision of labour in society, and the resulting gains in productivity [11].

<br>
**COMPUTATION**

Computation refers to the use of algorithms to convert a certain kind of available input into a certain kind of useful output, with a high probability.

Computation is _substrate independent_: it can happen throughout a network of digital computers; throughout a hierarchy of employees in a bureaucracy; in a machine; or though the actions of participants performing a ritual. Brian Arthur suggests that &quot;the economy is an ongoing _computation_ – a vast, distributed, massively parallel, stochastic one&quot; [12].

To prevent crippling congestion, dense urban areas require a level of conscious orchestration that is not required in sparser settings. Hence, for example, urban planners are involved in the _programming_ of multi-use spaces; urban traffic engineers implement demand-responsive traffic control systems (e.g. _dynamic reversible lanes_); and urban school administrators rely on clearinghouse algorithms to match students and schools [13].

Large institutions and organizations embody algorithms – to the degree than they rely on impersonal decision-making through a set of consistent and stable rules, where the order of operations matters. These institutions control the flow of information to make effective decisions. For example, a court of law permits the sharing of some kinds of information, at certain times, and not others, following certain procedures, etc. Urbanites come to know that, much like a digital computer, an institution that serves many people is relatively &#39;dumb&#39;: if you do not present it with the right information in the right format at the right time, it will not work for you.

Long before the _Smart City_, the challenges of information processing and logistics determined the structure and scalability of societies [14].

<br>
**TRUST**

The technical ability to interact and transact counts for naught if potential participants lack the mutual trust to carry through. Various _social dilemmas_ (_holdup problem, tragedy of the commons_, _principle-agent problem_, etc.) plague societies, keeping them off the effective frontier. And the fact that contracts are necessarily incomplete means that every transaction carries risk [15].

The purpose of institutions is to address society&#39;s social dilemmas and _coordination problems_. However, institutions are only effective to the degree that people trust them enough to rely on them. Further, a culture of trust reduces the cost of governance to the degree that it makes self-governance possible [16].

A loss of trust in institutions can cause organized systems – such as markets, collective action groups, organizations – to _unravel_. Because &quot;[t]here is an element of trust in every transaction&quot; [17], trust is the foundational dimension of society.

<br>
**INTENSITY AND EXTENISTY**

Whereas Transportation and Communication are dimensions of _extensity_, Computation and Trust are dimensions of _intensity_.

Extensity describes a society&#39;s reach, or domain of accessibility. It is expressed in the spatial dimension. It defines the &#39;_extent_ of the market&#39;, or, more broadly, the extent of a society.

Intensity describes a society&#39;s willingness (Trust) and ability (Computation) to do more with less. It is expressed in the temporal dimension. For example, there are various institutions for, and cultures around, the sharing of resources and commons. They engage in scheduling, load balancing, peak spreading, demand management, etc. – to prevent:

- Under-utilization, which represents inefficiency;
- Over-utilization, which diminishes the _level of service_; and
- Misuse, which destroys the resource or commons.

Whereas hyper-extensity is the hallmark of empire, hyper-intensity is the hallmark of metropolis.

<br>
**TRANSLATING DIMENSIONS**

Transportation infrastructure serves the movement of people, goods, and materials, but they also serve as communication networks for:

- The tacit, or embodied, knowledge of the travellers;
- The embedded information of the artifacts in carriage; and
- The explicit, or codified, information of the documents in carriage.

As such, there is a quasi equivalence between Transportation and Communication in that they both get things from where they are to where they are wanted. Attempts are often made to translate the former dimension into the latter, for example, with telecommuting and teleconferencing. However, even when there is something gained, there is always something &#39;lost in translation&#39; from one medium to the other, whether it is contextual information, sensory information, speed, or some other affordance.

Just as there are attempts to replace Transportation with Communication there are attempts to replace Trust with Computation. To some degree, this is necessary as a city scales. Past the _Dunbar number_, a group of people naturally need to rely more on impersonal institutional processes than on trustful relationships with everyone around them. An exchange between Computation and Trust is never absolute, but a matter of degree. However, wherever people are seen as fungible, the willingness to develop trustful relationships is more and more taking a back seat to the certainty that computation affords. For example, a car rental company may choose to employ edge computing and surveillance technologies in its cars to not only monitor, but also to ensure contract compliance through automated, remote actuation. In other words, instead of trusting its clients, the rental company enhances its ability to monitor and control them using algorithms [18].

Transportation and Communication are imperfect substitutes, and so are Trust and Computation. Trust is &quot;a unique governance mechanism in that it promotes voluntary, non-obligating exchanges of assets and services between actors&quot;. A high-trust society need not wait for a formal institution or governance technology to be invented and implemented before its citizens explore and exploit new positive sum games. The degree to which a society circumvents the requirement of exercising trust, is the degree to which its &#39;trust muscle&#39; atrophies or fails to develop. This inevitably leaves it vulnerable to disruptions and unintended failures in the Techno-economic Order [19].

**REPRESENTING THE FOUR DIMENSIONS**

If the resources of Communication and Transportation determine the _extent_ of society, then those for Computation and Trust may be said to determine the society&#39;s _depth_ and _pitch_, respectively. The figure below depicts this stylized geometric representation.

</figure>

This simple depiction is meant to evoke several things:

- There is no Trust or Computation without Communication and Transportation. However, a large agglomeration of people with no Trust or Computation is not a society, but a &#39;flattened&#39; warzone;
- The technologies and institutions of Computation are only effectual to the extent that people Trust them, i.e. distrust can eliminate the gains of Computation;
- The deeper Computation permeates into a society, the less explicable and transparent are its working and influences; and
- The stability of a society rests, to a significant degree, on its level of Trust.
