title: "The Three Orders of Organized Human Activity"
published: true
---

It is not uncommon for a metaphysical schema to take the form of a foundational triplicate [1]. _The Three Orders of Organized Human Activity_ is such a triplication, whose aim is to usefully frame the complex domain of human relations. The three orders are:

1. The Institutional Order
2. The Techno-economic Order
3. The Cultural Order

The three orders, though mutually distinct in their roles, are inseparable.

It must be noted that these orders are not necessarily assemblages that can be easily identifiable in any collection of buildings or occupations. They do not necessarily cluster in physical, or any other conceptual, space, other than the one defined here. They exist, rather, at different scales of all organized human interactions, within households, firms, neighbourhoods, cities, nations, etc.

If one were to compare a society to an individual, then the Institutional Order, Techno-economic Order, and Cultural Order may seem functionally isomorphic to the old categories of Reason, Body, and Soul, respectively.

The term _organized_ is simply there to omit instances where order seems to have dissolved into chaos, and homo sapiens ceases to display the characteristics that make us unique among animals (i.e. the unfortunate instances where _homo homini lupus_). However, the phrase &#39;organized human activity&#39; could have easily been replaced by &#39;society&#39; or &#39;complex society&#39;.

The figure below illustrates the arrangement of the Three Orders and gives examples of their modes of interaction. These will be further discussed.

**THE CULTURAL ORDER**

The Cultural Order encompasses the symbolic and behavioural patterns that emerge, bottom-up, from human interactions in various media. Therefore, all activities in the other two Orders (The Institutional Order and the Techno-economic Order) ultimately originate in the Cultural Order. A society with a strong Cultural Order, relative to the other two Orders, is often considered to be &#39;vibrant&#39; or &#39;lively&#39;, as the Cultural Order is the Order within which genuine expressions of the human will spring forth. The purest form of cultural expression is genuine expression without _economic orientation_.

The Techno-economic Order constitutes the _affordance_ and _salience landscapes_ of the Cultural Order. It, therefore, sets limits of what is technically feasible, but it also biases or incentivizes some cultural expressions over others. Some cohorts, in some biogeographies, are provided with &quot;more starting materials, and more favorable conditions for utilizing inventions&quot;, than do others. Hence, culture is expressed differently in evolving different landscapes across time [2].

One mode of interaction between the Cultural Order and the Techno-economic Order in modern societies is commerce. Commercial activities, including marketing, consumer choice, consumption, co-working, etc. are activities in which the Cultural Order and the Techno-economic Order reciprocally shape each other.

Culture is immanent to social relations and interactions. The degree to which a cultural expression alienates (abstracts) a phenomenon from its context (source) of creation is the degree to which it is considered to be a technology proper. That culture and technology exist on this continuum is the reason why some technological artifacts are called &#39;material culture&#39; (e.g. boomerangs, gothic cathedrals), and some cultural tools are called &#39;psychotechnologies&#39; or social technologies (e.g. languages, religious ideologies).

<br>
**THE TECHNO-ECONOMIC ORDER**

The Techno-economic Order encompasses all the activities in which technologies (both social and physical) are oriented toward the production of surplus value - including other technologies.

In their simplest forms, these technologies are ways of orchestrating matter, energy, and information towards human goals, and the social facilitation thereof [3]. However, the degree to which these processes are automated and decentralized in complex networks, is the degree to which they take on imperatives that are other than human. Hence, whereas the economist Adam Smith wrote about an _invisible hand_ that guides economic activities in a market economy [4], the technologist Kevin Kelly likens the vast network of technology covering the globe to &quot;a very complex organism that often follows its own urges&quot; [5].

The Techno-economic order encompasses all tools that mediate social interactions on a nontrivial scale, i.e. media. Most of these media are not ideologically impartial. They influence interactions, often imperceptibly, by constituting distinct affordance and salience landscapes. In other words, they determine the possibilities and probabilities of human interactions at scale. Technological mediation, therefore, distorts human intent as a consequence of extending human influence along various dimensions6.

The degree to which activities in the Techno-economic Order are automated (but not necessarily centralized or decentralized), is also the degree to which they approach the Institutional Order. Thus, engaged citizens demand transparency from both algorithms and institutions, both of which are prone to the _alignment problem_.

<br>
**THE INSTITUIONAL ORDER**

The Institutional Order encompasses all forms of governance of organized human activity. Its endeavour is to constitute a class of organs transcendent to society. The Institutional Order, therefore, approaches the other Orders from the top down. Institutions are a society&#39;s attempts to create a metaphysical reality that is collectively accepted to be almost as necessary and immutable as physical reality. As such, both institutional reality and physical reality are said to have &#39;laws&#39; [7].

Institutions are not only tools for addressing _social dilemmas_, they are the means by which a society attempts to constitute and protect its cherished values. For this reason, various interests often attempt to &#39;capture&#39; them. The ideal of operating in a space beyond society is never fully realizable; an institution is still part of a society.

Consistent and impersonal decision-making is usually the goal of institutions. This, however, can instantiate systematic bias, bureaucratic ossification, and a mismatch between the &#39;letter of the law&#39; and the &#39;spirit of the law&#39; - all dimensions of the alignment problem. Therefore, there is an inherent tension between the &#39;solid&#39; impartiality that affords an institution _legitimacy_ in the eyes of its citizens, and the adaptiveness to changing conditions that affords an institution _accountability_ to its citizens. When citizens find an institution illegitimate and unaccountable, they often express their lack trust in the institution by seeking alternative means of following their interests. These alternative means are often socially deleterious or suboptimal to possible institutional alterantives [8].

One mode of interaction between the Institutional Order and the Techno-economic order is policy. Policies are enacted through legislation and other softer initiatives. The enactment of a policy in the Institutional Order instantiates or alters a domain of organized human activity (e.g. a local cannabis industry). However, if this is to be done at any meaningful scale, then various technologies are required, for monitoring, dissemination, enforcement, etc. Therefore, the Institutional Order acts on, _and_ through, the Techno-economic Order using the products of the Techno-economic Order. This is why the above image shows the orders stacked rather than in a triangular formation. The Techno-economic Order mediates between the Cultural and Institutional Orders, not least because of the sheer scale of modern societies.

**POWER AND POLITICS**

In the drama of power and politics: the cultural expressions of citizens (Cultural Order) travel up through the apparatus of communication, aggregation, and processing (Techno-economic Order), which imperfectly translate them into the mechanisms of governance (Institutional Order). The influence travels back down in the form of enacted policies, which are distorted once again through the apparatus of command and control, in the attempts to influence and police the culture and economy.This process occurs distributed across multiple overlapping and non-overlapping spatial and temporal scales, in a path-dependent process that weaves the &#39;braid&#39; of a society&#39;s history.

New forms within, and modes between, the three Orders remain to be invented and tested.

The aggregate gradient of _social pressure_ [9] may be said to determine the broad character of a society. When social pressure flows strongly from the Cultural Order up into Institutional Order the society is called Democratic. When social pressure flows strongly from the Institutional Order down into the Cultural Order it is called Totalitarian [10]. When social pressure flows strongly from the Techno-economic Order outward into the Cultural and Institutional Orders it is called Neoliberal, Plutocratic (upward), Instrumentarian [11] (downward), Consumerist (downward), and/or any variant representing the dominant _economic imperatives_. This is not necessarily to set up a hierarchy of superiority among the Three Orders; each is capable of its own kind of tyranny. However, a culture of trust is the best safeguard against most societal ills.
